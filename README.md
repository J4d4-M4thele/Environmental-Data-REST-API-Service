This project takes environmental data uploaded by the client, which in this case is the CCT Waste Minimisation Program, using a .txt file
and saves the data in an sql (H2-database) table which can then be queried. The processed data, is then accessed using a series of get requests allowing
the client to see trends in certain parts of the data as well as view averages, medians, minimum and maximum values.

This project is based on the graph (seen below) which shows a record of 3 types of waste that the CCT Waste Minimisation Program has collected over
a 5 year period (2016 - 2020)
